				<h2>We've got a housing problem in San Francisco.</h2>
				<p>Rent costs are rapidly growing, our population is increasing and we need more housing to help address both issues. San Francisco is lucky to be both a beacon of cultural change and technological innovation. Our rich history and the nature of the work being done not just in San Francisco, but the Bay Area at large, is due to our diversity and progressive vision.</p>
				
				<p>
					The goal for all societies should be prosperity for all. When success is achieved among part of the population, it shouldn't mean that others must suffer or live in fear of eviction.
				</p>
				
				<p>
				We want to know what's standing in our way. We want to know how we can make this better. Don't tell us it can't be fixed, we won't accept that. 
				</p>
				
				<p> The goal of this site is to help inform the public of some of the issues standing in our way. Over time it will grow to help clarify the problems using any available data. For now, it will continue to display the projects that are going on and how much of our housing goals are being addressed.
